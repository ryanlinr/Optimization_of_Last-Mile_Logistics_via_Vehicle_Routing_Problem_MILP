# Optimization_of_Last-Mile_Logistics_via_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_MILP
We modeled a last-mile delivery system as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). We used real- world pharmaceutical distribution dataset, and formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program  (MILP) but solved using Constraint Programming with Guided Local Search to handle scale.
